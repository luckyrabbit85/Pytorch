# Pytorch

This repository covers the essentials of PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, to help you get started with building and training models. PyTorch is known for its ease of use and its dynamic computation graph, making it a popular choice for researchers and practitioners alike.

In this repository, you will find tutorials written in Jupyter Notebooks and include clear explanations to help you solidify your understanding.

## Requirements
PyTorch >= 1.7
torchvision >= 0.8.2
Jupyter Notebook

## Usage
To get started with the tutorials, simply clone this repository and open the Jupyter Notebook files. You can run the code cells and modify them to see how the models work.

## Acknowledgments
We would like to acknowledge the PyTorch community for their continued contributions to the development of the framework and their support for users. We would also like to thank the Jupyter Notebook team for their work on the platform, which makes it easy to create and share interactive tutorials.
